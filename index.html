                    <p>Hello world my name is Freddy Rosales. I'm excited for this new journey in full stack web development, and I welcome the challenge that this journey will bring. I'm a 20 year veteran of the USAF and am looking to start a new and exciting career as a web devloper. I'm from Panama City, Panama. I love to cook, workout, play sports, spend time with my family and go to the beach. I love to surf as well which I learned traveling to Panama every summer as a kid, but it's hard to do that here in AZ so we make it to California as much as we can. I'm also an avid writer and am hoping my creativity and attention to detail can help me be successful in this new career.</p>

I look forward to this new opportunity and hope this is a chance to get to network and meet new people in this fast paced and challenging career field.</p>
